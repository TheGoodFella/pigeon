# Pigeon
Pigeon is a web broadcast chat. Pigeon is made of channels which you can join, and you can text to other people through them. Pigeon works in real time. Pigeon is cool, isn't it?

# Technologies
Pigeon backend runs under node.js which is connected to a MySQL database that provides users, messages and channels.
The frontend is light and responsive and uses WebSockets to communicate with the backend.

# Dependencies
Pigeon depends on different node.js modules to work:
* ws
* mysql
Pigeon does not include these modules out of the box so you must have them installed for Pigeon to work.
